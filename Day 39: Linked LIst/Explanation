LINKED LIST

The following are the types of linked list:
■ Singly Linked list
■ Doubly Linked list
■ Circular Linked list
■ Doubly Circular Linked list

The singly linked list is a data structure that contains two parts, i.e.,
one is the data part, and the other one is the address part, which contains the address of the next or the successor node. 
The address part in a node is also known as a pointer.

Representation of Linkedlist:

class Node{
 node next;
        int data;
        node(int data){
            this.data = data;
            this.next = null; 
        }
    }
    
In the above representation, we have defined a user-defined structure named
a Node containing two members, the first one is data of integer type, and the other
one is the pointer (next) of the node type.

A linked list can be used to implement dynamic memory allocation. The dynamic
memory allocation is the memory allocation done at the run-time.
