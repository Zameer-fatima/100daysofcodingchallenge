# 100daysofcodingchallenge
Hello Connections !! I will be posting the solutions of the questions from leetcode. You all are also welcome to suggest all the possible solutions regarding the problem.Hope this will help all of us to learn something new and exciting. 

As I have decided to cover the following topics first:
#Java-

1. Arrays (Done)
2. Strings
3. Patterns
4. Problems from Oops concept

I believe that this will build my problem solving skills and improves my logic.
If you have better plans than this then you are welcome to suggest me.

After completing this, I will switch to DSA and will solve the problems from all the topics of DSA those are as follows:
1. Linked list, Doubly linked list, Circular linked list etc.
2. Stack and queue
3. Searching and Sorting
4. Trees and Graphs
Etc.

I am open for all the suggestions. Can connect with me through my linkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/zameer-fatima-24b0451b6)
