Find first and last position of element in sorted array

Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Possible test cases:

Case 1: If user enters the value that is not present in the array.
Then in that case return [-1,-1].
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Case 2: If the array is empty and user gives target as 0.
Then also return [-1,-1]
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Case 3: If the user enters any character or string or any special character.
Then returns "invalid input"

(These are some test cases that i have collected. you can also share your suggestions on more such test cases.)
