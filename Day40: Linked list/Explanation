/*** Insertion At The Beginning Of The Linked List ***/

Inserting a new element into a singly linked list at beginning is quite simple. We just need to make a few adjustments in the node links. 

There are the following steps which need to be followed in order to insert a new node in the list at beginning.

Allocate the space for the new node and store data into the data part of the node. This will be done by the following statements (in java). 

node newNode = new node(data);

create a function named insertFirst where we write a code to insert the node at the beginning.

In this function, the first thing to be done is to check whether the head is 'null' or not.
If the head is 'null' then assign newnode to head and newnode to tail also.

If head is not null then perform, 

newnode -> next = head
head->newnode

This is how the node is inserted at the beginning.
