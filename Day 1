Day - 1
Taking this moment to thank our placement coordinator Mr. Shriram R sir for organizing such an informative Bootcamp session on last Sunday i.e. 25th of September. I found it so informative and interesting. He gave us very useful information regarding resume building and placement activities. As a student I was always underconfident in my coding skills but that session helped me gain confidence.
He suggested us to take the #100DaysCodingChallenge. From today onwards I am taking this challenge and I will try my best to remain consistent.
Further I would like to thank my program chair Dr. Kanchan Lata Kashyap ma'am for leading us in right way and be my mentor for this challenge.
And also I would like to thank Kunal Kushwaha for such an amazing JAVA + DSA playlist
