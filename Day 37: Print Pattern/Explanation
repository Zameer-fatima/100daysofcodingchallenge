Explanation:

In the above pattern the row is denoted by i and the column is denoted by j. 

We see that the first row prints number equal to number of rows i.e. n in this case. The second-row prints one number less than the row, and so on.

Here we have to use two for loops, the first for loop is for row and the second for loop for columns.

The first print statement prints a number at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

Now the value of i and j is incremented with each iteration.



For n=6 (the number of rows we want to print).

Iteration 1:

For i=2, 1<=6 (true)

For j=2, j<=6 (true)

print i,

The first print statement prints the number 1 six times at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

Now the value of i is increased to 3.



Iteration 2:

For i=3, 1<=6 (true)

For j=3, j<=6 (true)

print i,

The first print statement prints the number 2 five times at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

Now the value of i is increased to 4.



Iteration 3:

For i=4, 1<=6 (true)

For j=4, j<=6 (true)

print i,

The first print statement prints the number 3 four times at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

Now the value of i is increased to 5.



Iteration 4:

For i=5, 1<=6 (true)

For j=5, j<=6 (true)

print i,

The first print statement prints the number 4 three times at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

55

Now the value of i is increased to 6.



Iteration 5:

For i=6, 1<=6 (true)

For j=6, j<=6 (true)

print i,

The first print statement prints the number 5 two times at the first row and the second println statement prints the spaces and throws the cursor at the next line.

Now the value of i is increased to 7.



Iteration 6:

For i=7, 7<=7 (false)

The execution will stop when i becomes equal to n.
